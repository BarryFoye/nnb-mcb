# Noah 'n' Barry Minecraft Bot

## Prerequisites:
- **Laptop** - Clean install would be best.
This is an optional step and instructions can be found [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/give-your-pc-a-fresh-start-0ef73740-b927-549b-b7c9-e6f2b48d275e).
- **Windows 10** - can easily be done on linux or mac.
- **Email address** - For setting up a password manager account and github account.
We will use [Protonmail](https://protonmail.com/) as it is free and anonymous.
- **Password manager** - for managing passwords with a master password.
We will use [bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) as it is free and very comprehensive.
- **GitHub account** - for lesson access and pushing/pulling code.
We will use [GitHub](https://github.com/) for source code management and sharing.
- **Local environment**:
    - New virtual workspace - Clean space for development.
        1. On a Windows 10 machine, press the windows key and the tab key at the same time.
        2. In the top left corner you will see a box titled "New Desktop" and it has a plus sign. Click that.
        3. Just below it you will now see 2x desktops in small boxes, click the second one.
        4. Now you should have a fresh desktop to work with. You can navigate between the desktops by pressing the windows key and the right or left arrow keys at the same time. 
    - Git - for source control when developing and easy interaction with github.
    - VS Code (Latest) - advanced text editor for development.
    Download the latest and install from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
    Now this is done we need to configure VS Code so that we can use it for our project. We do this by adding extensions. 
    - Node (Latest) - JavaScript server to run code.
    - Minecraft (1.16.5) - the game to run the bot on.
    - Mineflayer (^3.9) - the library for programming the bot and interacting with the minecraft server.
